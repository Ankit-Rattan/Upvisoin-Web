                mess="When in January 2021, an interview was conducted of a first year boy who knew little to no knowledge of club functioning decided to sign up as a volunteer for UpVision. He was nervous, yet answered all of the questions with bravery and all the knowledge he possessed confidently. He was selected as a volunteer of this beautiful Club.

Fast Forward to August 2022, a third year boy sitting in an interview room, with vast experience of club functioning and atmosphere was suddenly given the duties of Deputy General Secretary, with the General Secretary leaving for his respective internship in a few weeks of time. 

To challenge his potential more, the club was rearranged and he was suddenly in charge of a total of 95 young aspiring students. I must say, the boy was initially nervous to take the stage to address 95 students. Somehow he gathered confidence and spoke -What's up UpVision !, and there was no looking back, from creating dedicated teams for open source contribution, gaming, programming club, gaming and robotics to conducting more than 20 events for the college in the first six months, to creating informative short videos on social media to create awareness among GenZ towards the latest technologies.

            The boy was me. UpVision helped me create leader-like qualities and helped me teach how to work from ground level to institutionalise certain ways for ease. UpVision also helped me grow as a person in all the domains with respect to my technical skills in public oratory. Reflecting on the positive impact it left on college students during my tenure that drove the students to innovate new ideas in the robotics field to gaming. My team and I were successful in creating a passionate coding environment in the college as well.

            UpVision was also incharge of creating a website for annual Tech-cultural Fest, and held various competitions in collaborations with other esteemed colleges. UpVision during my tenure incorporated the culture of inclusivity and power sharing on a rotatory basis for all the teams.

            Lastly, I wish the UpVision team all the very best. "
